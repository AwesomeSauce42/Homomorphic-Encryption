# Homomorphic Encryption
Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that permits users to perform computations on its encrypted data without first decrypting it.
### In this project, I have used the following three methods:
    1. Partially Homomorphic Encryption Algorithm called Paillier's Cryptosystem Algorithm.
    2 .Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren Scheme (BFV) 
    3. RSA Algorithm

## Pallier's Cryptosystem
It works as following:

### Public key encryption scheme
#### The basic public key encryption scheme has three stages:
    1. Generate a public-private key pair
    2. Encrypt a number
    3. Decrypt a number

### Helper functions:
    1. gcd(a,b) outputs the greatest common divisor of a and b.
    2. lcm(a,b) outputs the least common multiple of a and b.

### Key generation
#### Key generation works as follows:
    1. Pick two large prime numbers p and q, randomly and independently. Confirm that gcd(pq,(p−1)(q−1)) is 1. If not, start again.
    2. Compute n=pq.
    3. Define function L(x)=x−1n.
    4. Compute λ as lcm(p−1,q−1).
    5. Pick a random integer g in the set Z∗n2 (integers between 1 and n2).
    6. Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse μ=(L(gλmodn2))−1modn. If μ does not exist, start again from step 1.
    7. The public key is (n,g). Use this for encryption.
    8.The private key is λ. Use this for decryption.

### Encryption
#### Encryption can work for any m in the range 0≤m<n:
    1. Pick a random number r in the range 0<r<n.
    2. Compute ciphertext c=gm⋅rnmodn2.
    
### Decryption
#### Decryption presupposes a ciphertext created by the above encryption process, so that c is in the range 0<c<n2:
    1. Compute the plaintext m=L(cλmodn2)⋅μmodn. 
(Reminder: we can always recalculate μ from λ and the public key).

#### This scheme allows two types of computation:
    1. Addition of two ciphertexts
    2. Multiplication of a ciphertext by a plaintext number


To implement this code in Python, We need the following modules:
math, random, sys, gympy2, time, Crypto.Util.number, numpy

## BFV SCHEME
Simple Python implementation of Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) homomorphic encryption scheme following the definitions in the [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144.pdf).

The Fan-Vercauteren (FV) scheme, (also known as the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme) is considered as one of the second generation of FHE schemes that is constructed based on the Ring-Learning with Errors (RLWE) problem [LPR13]. BFV is instantiated over two rings: 1) the plaintext ring which includes encodings of unencrypted or intelligible messages and 2) the ciphertext ring which includes encrypted messages. Similar to any other FHE scheme, BFV allows an untrusted party to induce meaningful computation over encrypted data without access to the decryption key. This is possible due to the homomorphism property which offers a map (or function) between the plaintext and ciphertext spaces that preserves the operations in these two spaces.

#### More info [here](https://inferati.com/blog/fhe-schemes-bfv).

The main program to run is BFV_FHE.py .
This code takes in 2 integer messages form the users and encrypts them, and also shows us the Homomorphic properties of the encrypted data (ciphertext)

 ## RSA Algorithm
 ### It works as the following:
    1. Take two distinct, large primes `p` and `q`.
    2. Ideally these have a similar byte-length.
    3. Multiply `p` and `q` and store the result in `n`.
    4. Find the totient for `n` using the formula: ` 𝜑(𝑛) = (𝑝−1)⋅(𝑞−1) `.
    5. Take an `e` coprime that is greater, than 1 and less than `n`.
    6. Find `d` using the formula ` 𝑑⋅𝑒 ≡ 1 mod 𝜑(𝑛) `.
    7. At this point, the pair (`e`, `n`) is the public key and the private key (`d`, `n`) is the private key.

  ### The code I have written (RSA_Algo.py):
- Uses Gen_prime.py to generate prime numbers.
- Creatse a private and public keys.
- Messages Encryption.
- Messages Decrypted.
- Shows Homomorphic Properties.
